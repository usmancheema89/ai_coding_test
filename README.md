  I have created a portable conda environment file by the name of "ai_test.yml".
  To setup the environment use the following command in conda terminal
  
  "conda env create -f ai_test.yml"
  
  To run the program simply run the Test.py file. It will evaluates the images in Test directory and save the predictions in Predictions.csv file.
  
  
Please let me know if you have anytrouble running the program.
